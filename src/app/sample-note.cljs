"# よう
The word よう(様) means `appearance` or `manner`. Because it is a noun we can modify it with い-adjectives or descriptive clauses.

---
### RELATIVE-CLAUSE(連体形) + よう
＊Aようだ　`seems like A`

In this usage a relative clause can be anything that is able to directly modify a noun, including い-adjectives, conjugated state-of-being, and verb-clauses. See #2.

#### Examples
- ここには、誰もいない**よう**だ。　`Appears that no one is here`
- 映画を見た**よう**です。 `Appears that the movie was already watched`

---
### NOUN/な-ADJECTIVE + よう
＊Aのようだ　`seems like an A`

Because よう is an ordinary noun, we need to use の to modify it with other nouns, and な to modify it with な-adjectives.

#### Examples
- 先生**のよう**だ。　`Seems like a teacher.`
- ここは静か**のよう**だ。　`Here seems quiet.`

---
### よう + な + NOUN
＊AのようなB　`an A-like B`

We can also use the whole 〜よう clause as if it were a な-adjective to describe other nouns.

#### Examples
- マギー**のような**先生　`A teacher like Maggie`
- 夢**のような**生活　`A dreamy life`
- 嘘**のような**話す　`An almost unbelievable story`
- そこはまるでおとぎ話**のような**世界だった　`It was as if the world was like a fairy tale`
   - <sup>`NOTE`</sup> まるで is often used with よう to add the meaning of `\"just\"`, `\"as if\"`.

---
### RELATIVE-CLAUSE + よう + な + 気がする
Aような気がする。`I feel like A`

We can use this structure to \"I feel **like** A\", which is a very common pattern in english.

#### Examples
- 聞かないような気がする。　`I feel like you don't listen.`

---
### NOUN + の + よう + に + VERB
＊AのようにB　`to to do B like A`

Instead of saying something *is* like something else, you can also say something *does something* like something else. In this case **A** can be another noun, a relative clause (such as a verb), or even a point in time (e.g. 去年).

#### Examples
- マギー**のように**教える。　`To teach like Maggie ( To teach in a way life Maggie )`
- 恋愛は映画**のように**はうまくいかない。　`Relationships don't work out like in the movies.`
- 彼女はまるで歌う**ように**話す。　`She talks like as if singing.`

---
### VERB-CLAUSE + よう + に + VERB
＊AようにB　`do B so that A`

This form is similar to the previous form. I don't quite understand it yet.

通りに is similar, but more concrete. `to do B just as A`, where as ように is more wishful, or hopeful. For examples `to do B as if to A`. In this sense it can mean `in order to`, e.g. `to study hard, as if to not make my teacher angry`.

ように can also be thought of as do B in the way of A. 

#### Examples
- もっとわかる**ように**話してください。　`Please talk, as if to be more understandable. ( Please talk in a way that is understandable )`
- こぼさない*ように*食べてください。　`Please eat in a way that doesn't spill`

---
### VERB-CLAUSE + よう + に + 言う
＊Aように言った　`was told to A`

This form seems similar to と言う, but I'm not quite sure what the nuance is. Could be just less concrete.

#### Examples
- 車は危ないからバスでここまで来るように言われました。　`I was told to come here by bus because driving car is dangerous.`
- メールをチェックするように言っています。　`They are saying to check my email.`

---
### VERB-CLAUSE + よう + に + なる
＊Aようになる　`doing A now`

This form implies a change in state.

#### Examples
- 日本語を話せるようになりました。　`I am able to speak Japanese now.`"
